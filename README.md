# Non-Developer Agentic Toolkit

**AI-powered workflows for thinking work, not coding work.**

This toolkit helps knowledge workers, managers, and non-technical professionals leverage AI for research, decision-making, strategic planning, and knowledge management—without writing a single line of code.

## Who This Is For

You work with **ideas, information, and decisions** as your primary output. You might be:

- **A manager or leader** making strategic decisions and building team knowledge
- **A consultant or advisor** conducting client research and creating deliverables
- **A knowledge worker** (writer, analyst, project manager, product manager)
- **An individual contributor** learning new domains and managing personal knowledge

**You do NOT need to know how to code.** These workflows are designed for professionals who think, research, decide, and synthesize—not developers.

## What This Toolkit Does

Transform hours of manual work into minutes of guided AI collaboration:

- **Research any topic** in 20-30 minutes instead of 4-6 hours
- **Make strategic decisions** using proven frameworks (Drucker, Wardley Mapping)
- **Summarize articles and videos** with consistent formatting and metadata
- **Create communication materials** (InfoBits, weekly updates, team knowledge)
- **Facilitate strategic planning** with structured methodologies
- **Integrate findings** into your personal knowledge system

## Quick Start: Try the Research Workflow

The most powerful workflow in this toolkit. Use it to research any topic systematically:

```
/research I want to understand [TOPIC].

[Optional: Describe what you're trying to accomplish and why]
```

**Real example:**
```
/research I want to understand Toyota Kata and Scientific Thinking.

Why: I've heard about continuous improvement but want to understand 
the specific practice of improvement kata and coaching kata.
Value: Looking for concrete techniques that bridge theory to practice.
```

**What you get in ~30 minutes:**
- 1,000-2,000 word comprehensive synthesis
- Multiple topics investigated with authoritative sources
- Direct quotes and practical frameworks
- Clear action items and implementation guidance

## Core Workflows

### Research & Learning
- **`/research`** - Comprehensive research on any topic ([guide](docs/using-the-research-workflow.md) | [examples](examples/))
- **`/article-summary`** - Summarize web articles with consistent formatting ([guide](docs/using-article-summary-workflow.md))

### Decision-Making & Strategy
- **`/decision-facilitation`** - Structured decision-making using Drucker's framework ([guide](docs/using-decision-facilitation-workflow.md))
- **`/wardley-mapping`** - Facilitate strategic mapping sessions ([guide](docs/using-wardley-mapping-workflow.md) | [example](examples/facilitating-wardley-mapping.md))

### Communication & Knowledge Management
- **`/create-infobits`** - Create bite-sized communication materials ([guide](docs/using-infobits-workflow.md) | [example](examples/infobits-weekly-communication.md))

## How AI Works Differently Here: Active Partner

The AI in this toolkit doesn't just execute commands—it **partners with you** to clarify your thinking before investing time and effort.

**Active Partner asks:**
- "What are you trying to achieve?"
- "Have you considered this alternative?"
- "I see a contradiction here—can you clarify?"

**Why this matters:** A few minutes clarifying your goal saves hours of rework and produces output that actually meets your needs.

Think of it as a **safety net** that catches unclear intent before wasting effort on output that misses the mark.

## Key Concepts

### AI Research vs. Human Research

**AI Research = Summarization**
- Finds and extracts content from sources
- Organizes information thematically
- Creates comprehensive overviews

**Human Research = Integration**
- Integrates findings with existing knowledge
- Makes connections and judgments
- Applies insights to specific context

**This toolkit handles AI research. You handle integration.**

### Fertilizer vs. Plants

**Research notes are fertilizer** - exterior content that enriches your knowledge but isn't your knowledge itself.

**Your notes are plants** - your thoughts, observations, and connections that grow from the fertilizer.

**Keep them separate** to maintain quality and avoid the machine-feeding-itself problem.

## Real-World Examples

### Toyota Kata and Scientific Thinking
Research on continuous improvement practices, improvement kata, coaching kata, and PDCA cycles. 30 minutes produced 2,000+ words of synthesis with practical implementation guidance.

### Modern Knowledge Work Frameworks
Comprehensive research on OKRs, Deep Work, cognitive load theory, remote work practices, and AI augmentation. Multi-topic synthesis connecting productivity frameworks.

## Getting the Most Value

1. **Start with real needs** - Use workflows for actual work, not practice
2. **Engage actively** - Shape research topics, challenge assumptions, refine direction
3. **Integrate, don't just file** - Schedule time to connect findings to your knowledge
4. **Build your practice** - Develop better question-asking and direction-setting skills
5. **Share and collaborate** - Use outputs to build team knowledge and facilitate decisions

## Related Projects

This toolkit is the non-developer companion to the [Agentic Dev Ecosystem Template](https://github.com/djscheuf/agentic-dev-ecosystem-template), which provides similar workflows optimized for software development (TDD, code analysis, implementation planning).

**Key difference:** This toolkit focuses on **thinking work** (research, decisions, strategy), while the dev template focuses on **coding work** (implementation, testing, architecture).

## Your First Steps

1. **Read** [Using the Research Workflow](docs/using-the-research-workflow.md) (10 minutes)
2. **Review** a real example: [Toyota Kata](examples/toyota-kata-scientific-thinking.md) or [Knowledge Work Frameworks](examples/modern-knowledge-work-frameworks.md)
3. **Try** the `/research` workflow with a real question you need answered
4. **Integrate** your findings into your own notes and thinking
5. **Explore** other workflows: [Decision Facilitation](docs/using-decision-facilitation-workflow.md), [Wardley Mapping](docs/using-wardley-mapping-workflow.md), or [InfoBits](docs/using-infobits-workflow.md)

**Remember**: These workflows are tools for compression and organization. The real value comes from your integration and application of the findings. Keep fertilizer and plants separate, and you'll build knowledge that's actually yours.
