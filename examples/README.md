# Research Workflow Examples

This directory contains real-world examples of the research workflow in action. Each example demonstrates how the workflow transforms a research question into comprehensive, well-organized documentation in 20-40 minutes.

## Available Examples

### [Toyota Kata and Scientific Thinking](toyota-kata-scientific-thinking.md)

**Domain**: Process improvement and coaching

**Initial Question**: How do Toyota Kata and Scientific Thinking provide concrete techniques for continuous improvement?

**What You'll Learn**:
- The Improvement Kata pattern (4-step model for iterative progress)
- The Coaching Kata pattern (5 questions for developing learners)
- Connection to PDCA and scientific method
- Shu Ha Ri progression from novice to master
- Common implementation mistakes and how to avoid them

**Research Highlights**:
- 10 topics investigated
- 461 lines of detailed findings
- 2,000+ word synthesis
- ~30 minutes of guided conversation

**Best For**: Managers, team leads, and anyone interested in systematic approaches to continuous improvement and coaching.

### [Modern Knowledge Work Frameworks](modern-knowledge-work-frameworks.md)

**Domain**: Productivity measurement and optimization

**Initial Question**: How do we measure and optimize knowledge work in the modern era?

**What You'll Learn**:
- OKRs and outcome-based metrics (moving beyond time tracking)
- Deep Work measurement and the 4DX framework
- Cognitive Load Theory and practical management techniques
- Asynchronous communication patterns for remote work
- AI augmentation and new skill requirements
- Deliberate practice for systematic skill development

**Research Highlights**:

### [Facilitating Wardley Mapping](facilitating-wardley-mapping.md)

**Domain**: Strategic planning and facilitation

**Initial Question**: How do you effectively facilitate Wardley Mapping sessions with teams?

**What You'll Learn**:
- The 5-step mapping process (users, needs, capabilities, evolution, value chain)
- Three facilitation approaches (Wing It, Get Strict, Cross-Pollinate)
- Evolution stages and how to assess them
- Value chain construction techniques
- Session design and collaboration best practices
- When and how to use submaps for complexity management

**Research Highlights**:
- Multiple topics covering process, facilitation, and strategic analysis
- 849 lines of detailed findings
- Comprehensive synthesis of facilitation best practices
- ~40 minutes of guided conversation

**Best For**: Facilitators, strategists, consultants, and anyone leading strategic planning sessions.

## What These Examples Demonstrate

### 1. Non-Technical Focus

Unlike technical implementation research, these examples focus on:
- **Management practices** (Toyota Kata)
- **Productivity frameworks** (Knowledge Work)
- **Facilitation techniques** (Wardley Mapping)

All three are relevant to knowledge workers, managers, and leaders—not just developers.

### 2. Comprehensive Coverage

Each example shows:
- **Initial prompt** - How the research was requested
- **Research summary** - 1,000-2,000 word synthesis
- **Topics for research** - Complete checklist with sources
- **Research notes** - Detailed findings organized by theme

### 3. Practical Application

The research notes aren't just academic—they provide:
- **Actionable frameworks** you can use immediately
- **Common mistakes** to avoid
- **Implementation guidance** for real-world application
- **Quality standards** and best practices

### 4. Thematic Organization

Notice how content is organized by **concept/theme**, not by source:
- Same source appears in multiple sections when it addresses different angles
- Makes findings easier to navigate and reference
- Reveals patterns across multiple sources

### 5. Attribution Discipline

Every quote and summary includes source URLs:
- Enables verification of claims
- Allows deeper exploration of specific topics
- Provides context for future reference
- Maintains intellectual honesty

## How to Use These Examples

### For Learning the Workflow

1. **Pick an example** that matches your interest
2. **Read the initial prompt** to see how the research was requested
3. **Scan the topics list** to see how the AI proposed research angles
4. **Read the research summary** to get the synthesized findings
5. **Explore research notes** to see detailed extraction with attribution

### For Understanding Your Domain

If you're interested in:
- **Process improvement** → Start with Toyota Kata
- **Productivity optimization** → Start with Knowledge Work Frameworks
- **Strategic planning** → Start with Wardley Mapping

### For Modeling Your Own Research

Use these as templates:
- See how to structure research requests with context
- Observe how topics branch from initial questions
- Note the balance between quotes (precision) and summaries (comprehension)
- Study how themes emerge from multiple sources

## Time Investment vs. Value

| Example | Time Invested | Manual Research Time | Value Delivered |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Toyota Kata | ~30 minutes | 4-6 hours | Complete understanding of improvement and coaching kata |
| Knowledge Work | ~35 minutes | 6-8 hours | Integrated framework across 5 domains |
| Wardley Mapping | ~40 minutes | 6-8 hours | Comprehensive facilitation guide |

**Average time savings**: 85-90% reduction in research time while improving comprehensiveness.

## Next Steps

1. **Read an example** that matches your current needs
2. **Try the workflow** with your own research question
3. **Compare your results** to these examples
4. **Refine your approach** based on what you learn
