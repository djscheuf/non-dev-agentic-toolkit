# Research Note: Facilitating Wardley Mapping
2026-02-03

## Overview
This research note synthesizes best practices and techniques for facilitating Wardley Mapping sessions, drawing from multiple authoritative sources. It serves as reference material for developing facilitation workflows and prompts.

---

## Core Mapping Process

### The Basic Steps
According to Learn Wardley Mapping's Landscape guide, the fundamental process is straightforward:

> "Wardley Mapping is a straight-forward process, and most difficulties boil down to concerns about making 'mistakes' or doing the 'wrong' thing. It is much more valuable to discard these concerns up-front, embrace the messiness of the process, and learn by boldly doing."

**The 5-Step Process** (Source: https://learnwardleymapping.com/landscape/):
1. Identify the Users being served
2. Identify the Needs to be met (think of these as top-level Capabilities)
3. Identify the Capabilities needed to successfully meet those needs
4. Determine the stage of Evolution for each Capability by evaluating its characteristics
5. Draw the complete value chain — User at the top, Needs and Capabilities underneath, with dependency relationships included

**Key Principle**: "An incorrect model that is also useful is the definition of success." (Source: https://learnwardleymapping.com/landscape/)

### Understanding the Map Structure

**The Axes** (Source: https://itrevolution.com/articles/how-to-wardley-map/):
- **Y-axis (Vertical)**: Represents visibility to the user. "Like a traditional value chain, the higher the component, the more the user can see it."
- **X-axis (Horizontal)**: Contains four stages of evolution—Genesis, Custom Built, Product, and Commodity

**The Four Evolution Stages** (Source: https://itrevolution.com/articles/how-to-wardley-map/):

1. **Genesis (Stage I)**: "The object is rare, poorly understood, and uncertain. There is the potential to have high future worth... It should be a competitive advantage and experimentation is rife."

2. **Custom Built (Stage II)**: "More people are starting to consume and understand the object. The market is forming, and there is potential ROI... The key focus is learning."

3. **Product/Rental (Stage III)**: "Consumption is rapidly increasing as the market grows. The object is profitable, new features can differentiate it, and there is a refinement of needs."

4. **Commodity/Utility (Stage IV)**: "The object is widespread and stabilizing. It's a mature and ordered market... Operational efficiency is king, and failure is not tolerated in the market."

**Placement Guidance**: "It's not a precise act; it should feel about right. Sometimes an easy way to start is to place the least common elements to the left on the x-axis (Genesis) and the more common elements to the right (Commodity)." (Source: https://itrevolution.com/articles/how-to-wardley-map/)

## Facilitation Approaches

### The Challenge of Group Mapping
From Learn Wardley Mapping's facilitation article (https://learnwardleymapping.com/2021/03/15/wardley-mapping-facilitation/):

> "In Wardley Mapping, if you want to go fast, you go alone. But if you want to go far — and build all that good 'shared understanding' stuff we hear about — you need friends. You need to map with others!"

**Why Group Mapping is Hard**:
1. **Legitimacy problem**: "Is Wardley Mapping the right tool for us? And is all this hard work really worth it?" Benefits aren't always clear, requiring influence and proof-of-value.
2. **Literacy problem**: "How does it work? What does this or that term mean? How do we choose what goes in the map?"
3. **Facilitation challenge**: Managing discussion, disagreement, and understanding across larger groups.

**Why Group Mapping Matters**:
- "More perspectives in the mix means catching things you'd otherwise miss"
- "Mapping together builds consensus and buy-in"
- Creates "shared language needed to hold semantically dense, nuanced conversations"
- "You had better get used to mapping with others before the validity of your individual assumptions becomes the limiting factor on decision quality"

### Three Facilitation Approaches

#### 1. Wing It (Informal/Exploratory)
**Description** (Source: https://learnwardleymapping.com/2021/03/15/wardley-mapping-facilitation/):
> "I am a big fan of winging it. It's messy, and that's okay! Just get folks into a (virtual) room with some sticky notes (for example, in Miro) and follow Simon's instructions in Chapter 2 of his book. Start with users, and work your way through user needs, capabilities, relationships, and evolution."

**Best For**: Pairs and small groups
**Key Materials**: Simon's reference tables and the Cheat Sheet (Figure 17)
**Challenge**: "As you start to deal with larger groups, this gets more and more difficult to manage well. Discussion, disagreement, and issues of understanding can easily start to crowd out the actual process."
**Tip**: "Make a habit of noting disagreement and moving on, since that can help save the momentum."

#### 2. Get Strict (Structured Consensus)
**The Process** (Source: https://learnwardleymapping.com/2021/03/15/wardley-mapping-facilitation/):
1. Agree (negotiate) on one user
2. Agree (negotiate) on one need which that user has
3. Agree (negotiate) on one capability required to fulfill that user's need
4. Agree (negotiate) on how evolved that capability is
5. Search the map for opportunities using Wardley's climate patterns, doctrinal principles, and strategic gameplays
6. Expand from point 3 to add more capabilities (repeat as necessary)
7. Expand from point 2 to add more needs, then more capabilities (repeat)
8. Expand from point 1 to add more users, then needs, then capabilities (repeat)

**Reality Check**: "Obviously, this is an overwhelmingly fussy process, which no group of people can reasonably be expected to follow. But you might make a light-hearted, semi-unserious attempt to follow it, skipping steps as needed. The point is to have just enough structure for the group to overcome the hurdle of getting started."

#### 3. Cross-Pollinate (Small Group Consensus)
**The Approach** (Source: https://learnwardleymapping.com/2021/03/15/wardley-mapping-facilitation/):
> "This third option is about small group consensus and cross-pollination — many agreements, with differences across groups, rather than one Big Idea or one big map."

**Implementation**:
- Have people make maps in small groups (Zoom breakout rooms work well)
- Create ways to share and compare:
  - Each group does a readout to the full room
  - Rotate one person from each group into another group to cross-pollinate ideas
- "The important thing is to create opportunities to notice and discuss differences"

**Key Strength**: "It doesn't necessarily require complete agreement among everyone involved. The intention and the value is in surfacing the assumptions of stakeholders, many of which may never have been voiced before!"

**Variations Mentioned**:
- Mob mapping (inspired by Woody Zuill's mob programming)
- Mashups with Liberating Structures' Troika consulting

## Practical Collaboration Guidelines

### Session Design Essentials
From IT Revolution's guide (https://itrevolution.com/articles/how-to-wardley-map/):

> "Designing a practical collaboration session is essential. There are a few key areas to consider."

**Pre-Session**:
- "Ensure all participants are willing to try the session"
- "Provide some simple preparation work or contextual materials that people can read ahead of time"

**During Session**:
- "Allocate enough time to create the map; don't rush"
- "Set the right tone: everyone is participating in the map—it's not a presentation"
- "Facilitate fairly—let people speak, make their point, and add to the map"
- "Welcome all suggestions and don't dismiss ideas out of hand"

**Facilitation Principle**: "Just like a good meeting, a good mapping session relies on participants being prepared to contribute. The facilitator should allocate enough time so everyone can share without rushing the work."

### Starting Simple
From IT Revolution (https://itrevolution.com/articles/how-to-wardley-map/):
> "The best way to start mapping is to go to a board or grab a pencil and paper and just try it... it's important to keep early sessions simple."

**Three Key Phrases to Remember**:
1. **Harvest Other Ideas**: "Don't copy a map. Use another map or document to understand your organization's dependencies."
2. **Collaborate on the Map**: Focus on participation and fair facilitation
3. **Present It as a Story**: The map should instantly build the story in your head

### Testing Map Quality
**The Story Test** (Source: https://itrevolution.com/articles/how-to-wardley-map/):
> "Weeks or months after the fact, you may well come back to the map to see if the story still makes sense. If the map instantly builds the story in your head, then that's a good sign."

**The Communication Test**: "Present the map to someone who was not at the initial meeting and ask them to tell the map's story. Did they get it?"

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

From Wardley Maps 101 guide (https://www.wardleymaps.com/guides/wardley-mapping-101):

### 1. Starting Too Broad
"Begin with a simple map focused on one user need which you have contact with. Do not speculate."

### 2. Custom Bias
"You might have many custom components. It does not mean that everyone else has them."

### 3. Static Thinking
"Wardley Maps are dynamic. Think how components might change."

### 4. Focusing on Internal Structure
"Focus on the value chain, not your organizational chart."

---

## Advanced Mapping Elements

### Pipelines
From IT Revolution (https://itrevolution.com/articles/how-to-wardley-map/):
> "A pipeline shows the continuous evolution of a component, usually when there is a clear path of evolution, not just a shift."

**Characteristics**:
- Shows continuous evolution along the x-axis
- Cost is typically high on the left (Genesis) and lower on the right (Commodity)
- "You can think of a pipeline as a slider from which you can select one component... not both together"

### Submaps
> "When a map becomes complex, you might need to make a submap... Usually, this is illustrated on the main map by a square or simply via an annotation. You would then create the submap on a separate board or paper. Make sure to keep it close to your master map."

---

## Step-by-Step Creation Guide

From Wardley Maps 101 (https://www.wardleymaps.com/guides/wardley-mapping-101):

### Step 1: Identify Your User Need
"Start with the user need at the top of your map. This should be a clear, specific need that your business addresses."
Example: "Store and share photos online"

### Step 2: Map Your Value Chain
"Work backwards from the user need, identifying each component in your value chain."

### Step 3: Position Components by Evolution Stage
"Place each component on the map according to its evolution stage. Genesis components go on the left, Commodity components on the right."

### Step 4: Add Movement Indicators
"Show which components are evolving and in what direction."
Example: Photo Storage → moving from Product to Commodity

---

## Building Value Chains: Techniques and Best Practices

### The Three Questions Technique

From Learn Wardley Mapping's article on value chain challenges (https://learnwardleymapping.com/2021/08/31/common-challenges-working-with-value-chains/):

> "Let's go through each part, one by one, and ask these questions... 1) what is this made of? 2) what does it depend on? 3) what depends on it?"

**Application**: "Do this for each component, and you'll very quickly see what depends on what else and how all the relationships fit together."

This systematic approach prevents missing dependencies and reveals the structure of the value chain through iterative questioning. Rather than trying to map everything at once, focus on one component at a time and build the network of relationships.

### Value Chain Structure

From Wardley Maps Official glossary (https://www.wardleymaps.com/glossary/value-chain):

**Definition**: "A value chain shows how your business creates value for customers. It maps the what is needed to deliver a solution that meets that need. Each node in the chain adds value and contributes to the final customer experience."

**The Four Layers**:

1. **User**: "The person or organization with the need - your target customer. This is often generalized to general 'Stakeholder', as any organization needs to balance needs of different stakeholders (f.e. customers want value, shareholders want profit)."

2. **User Needs**: "What your customer wants to achieve or the problem they need to solve."

3. **First line capabilities**: "How you reach and interact with users - your touchpoints and communication methods."

4. **Less visible capabilities**: "Capabilities that you need necessary to satisfy your customer needs. They might be yours or your vendors."

### When to Increase Specificity

From Learn Wardley Mapping (https://learnwardleymapping.com/2021/08/31/common-challenges-working-with-value-chains/):

> "If you increase the level of detail... exploding 'visualization' into its parts, you start to get a different idea view of the situation altogether."

**The Decision Point**: "I prefer a slightly more detailed view IF the component (in this case, Data Visualization) is important to understand and get right."

**Example Breakdown**: The article demonstrates breaking down "Data Visualization" into:
- Reporting (top-level function)
- Rendered Image (output)
- Image Definition (specification)
- Interpreter (data processor)
- Translator (conversion layer)
- Image Primitives (basic shapes/elements)
- Styling (visual design)

**Strategic Value**: "This level of specificity helps us appreciate exactly what kind of situation we're dealing with... you might, for example, see that there are very specific tradeoffs to be made."

The detailed view reveals which parts different software solutions cover, enabling better comparison and strategic decisions about build vs. buy.

### Avoiding Mixed Ontologies

From Learn Wardley Mapping (https://learnwardleymapping.com/2021/08/31/common-challenges-working-with-value-chains/):

**The Problem**: Mixing generic components ("Data Visualization") with specific instances ("Software X") in the same map.

> "Use option #2 from your first question, so we're not mixing the ontologies (in other words... so we're not having generic things and specific instances of that same thing in the same map... otherwise we might end up with a LOT of lines going every which way, which makes the map hard to use)."

**Three Approaches**:
1. Generic components only
2. Specific instances only
3. Generic components with boundaries showing what specific solutions cover

The third approach allows comparing different solutions by drawing boundaries around the parts each one handles, revealing coverage gaps and overlaps.

### Transaction Flow Thinking

From Learn Wardley Mapping (https://learnwardleymapping.com/2021/08/31/common-challenges-working-with-value-chains/):

> "One trick we can use is to think about the map in terms of transactions. What is being passed around the system? From where, and to where?"

This perspective helps clarify actual dependencies versus assumed dependencies. By tracking what flows between components, facilitators can identify:
- Which components truly depend on which others
- What data/information is being transformed at each step
- Where handoffs occur in the system

### Collaborative Value Over Perfect Maps

From The Serverless Edge (https://theserverlessedge.com/dont-map-the-world-wardley-mapping-101/):

> "It's not about getting the map 'right'—it's about getting people talking."

**The Real Purpose**: "Mapping is especially powerful in collaborative settings. A value chain scribbled on a whiteboard (or Miro board) becomes a conversation starter. Experts challenge assumptions, fill in gaps, and offer perspectives you'd miss on your own."

From Learn Wardley Mapping facilitation article:

> "The intention and the value is in surfacing the assumptions of stakeholders, many of which may never have been voiced before! Group work like this makes those noticeable, and that alone goes a long way toward shared understanding about what the organization is doing, even if those assumptions are the subject of disagreement."

**Key Insight**: Perfect agreement isn't required. The value comes from making implicit assumptions explicit and creating shared understanding of different perspectives.

### Practical Mapping Guidelines

From The Serverless Edge (https://theserverlessedge.com/dont-map-the-world-wardley-mapping-101/):

**The Wardley Mapping Canvas** provides six structured steps:
1. **Purpose** – "Why are we mapping? What's the trigger? What outcome do we want?"
2. **Scope** – "What's in and out of scope? Don't map the world—stay focused."
3. **Users** – "Who is the primary user? Be explicit."
4. **User Needs** – "What do they need? Keep it to the essentials."
5. **Value Chain** – "What dependencies exist to satisfy those needs?"
6. **Mapping** – "Place components on the map according to their stage of evolution."

**Starting Simple**: "Focus on one user and one or two needs to start. You can expand later."

**Avoiding Scope Creep**: "This framework prevents teams from going too broad too quickly. Early on, our maps ballooned into unwieldy tangles of 50+ components. The canvas helps keep things lean, focused, and actionable."

### Capturing Observations During Mapping

From The Serverless Edge (https://theserverlessedge.com/dont-map-the-world-wardley-mapping-101/):

> "Capture Observations – Don't just build the map. Annotate it with insights, blockers, or opportunities to revisit later."

**Living Artifacts**: "Over time, maps evolve into living artefacts that guide decisions and help teams see where to go next."

**Example Application**: "For example, you might identify a custom-built component that should evolve into a commodity. The map sparks questions like: What's stopping us from doing that? Skills? Tech stack? Organisational inertia? Those notes then drive the next round of strategic discussions."

### Facilitation Best Practices

From The Serverless Edge (https://theserverlessedge.com/dont-map-the-world-wardley-mapping-101/):

**Key Principles**:
- **Start with Purpose**: "Always begin by asking: Why does this project exist? You'd be surprised how often teams struggle to answer this clearly."
- **Narrow the Scope**: "Resist the temptation to 'map the world.' Decide upfront what not to map."
- **Name Your User**: "Make the user concrete: 'Driver,' 'Customer,' 'Engineer.' Ambiguity kills clarity."
- **Facilitate, Don't Dictate**: "A good mapping session is collaborative. Encourage challenges and curiosity—never shut people down."

**The Iterative Nature**: "Your first Wardley Map is rarely perfect—and that's fine. The real value emerges in the conversations it enables and the insights it surfaces."

### Submaps and Nested Maps

From IT Revolution (https://itrevolution.com/articles/how-to-wardley-map/):

> "When a map becomes complex, you might need to make a submap... Usually, this is illustrated on the main map by a square or simply via an annotation. You would then create the submap on a separate board or paper. Make sure to keep it close to your master map."

From The Serverless Edge (https://theserverlessedge.com/understanding-wardley-mapping-a-guide-to-the-anatomy-of-a-map/):

> "Sub-maps: When a map becomes too complex, break it down into sub-maps to focus on specific areas without losing overall context."

**Purpose**: Submaps allow encapsulation of complex components that would clutter the main map, while maintaining the ability to "drill down" into detail when needed.

**Representation**: On the main map, the submap is typically shown as:
- A square or box around the component
- An annotation indicating a submap exists
- The submap itself is created separately but kept accessible

#### When to Use Submaps: Complexity Thresholds

From IT Revolution's Principles and Antipatterns (https://itrevolution.com/articles/principles-and-antipatterns-of-wardley-mapping/):

**Principle 4: Perspective** addresses submaps directly:

> "Either dive down into the weeds or go big. Set the scope at the start of the conversation and try to stick to it. It's one of the most challenging things and may require a 'parking lot' for submaps you'll draw later. It also reduces complexity: 'This component represents data; we can deep dive on the data landscape in a separate map.'"

**Principle 6: Focus** provides specific element count thresholds:

> "Don't map the world. It's very tempting to put everything down as a component. Once you have more than twenty elements (or components) on your map, it's gone too big—break it down."

**Antipattern 4: Over complicating** provides experience-based guidelines:

> "A map should simplify. It's okay to leave things out. There's a rule that the less experience you have in mapping, the simpler your map should be. Expert mappers: use no more than fifty elements in a map. Intermediates: no more than thirty elements. Beginners: don't use more than fifteen elements."

#### Decision Criteria for Submaps

Based on the research, create a submap when:

1. **Complexity threshold exceeded**: 
   - Beginners: >15 elements
   - Intermediates: >30 elements
   - Experts: >50 elements

2. **Scope management**: Component requires "diving into the weeds" that would distract from the main map's narrative

3. **Parking lot accumulation**: During mapping sessions, components identified for "deep dive later" should become submaps

4. **Perspective shift needed**: When a component represents an entire landscape (e.g., "data" representing the entire data landscape)

5. **Audience-specific views**: Different stakeholders need different granularity levels for the same system

#### Best Practices for Submaps

**Scoping Strategy** (from Principle 4):
- Set scope at the start of the conversation
- Use a "parking lot" for submaps to draw later
- Explicitly call out when a component will be detailed in a separate map
- Example phrasing: "This component represents data; we can deep dive on the data landscape in a separate map"

**Maintaining Context** (from The Serverless Edge):
- Break down complex maps into submaps "to focus on specific areas without losing overall context"
- Keep submaps close to the master map (physically or digitally)
- Ensure the submap maintains the same user anchor and perspective

**Simplification Principle** (from Antipattern 4):
- "A map should simplify. It's okay to leave things out."
- Use submaps to hide detail that isn't relevant to the current strategic conversation
- Remember: The conversation is more important than completeness

**Known Use Cases** (from practice and research):
- **Hierarchical personas with different granularity needs**: Manager view vs. developer view of the same system
- **Complex IT capabilities**: A component composed of numerous parts that can be encapsulated generically at one level but expanded in detail when needed
- **Audience-specific views**: Different stakeholders need different levels of detail for the same capability
- **Landscape deep-dives**: When a single component represents an entire domain (e.g., "data landscape," "infrastructure landscape")

## Evolution and Positioning: Assessment and Facilitation

### Evolution Stage Characteristics

From Wardley Maps Official (https://www.wardleymaps.com/glossary/evolution-stages):

**Detailed characteristics for each stage:**

#### 1. Genesis
"Novel, uncertain, constantly changing"

**Characteristics**:
- Novel and experimental
- Uncertain outcomes and applications
- Constantly changing and evolving
- High risk, high potential reward
- Limited availability and understanding

**Examples**: Emerging technologies (quantum computing), new business models (metaverse commerce, decentralized finance), novel customer needs (virtual reality experiences, sustainable alternatives)

**Strategic Focus**: Innovation and experimentation, early adoption and learning, building capabilities for future advantage

#### 2. Custom Built
"Growing, becoming more defined, scarce"

**Characteristics**:
- Growing adoption and understanding
- Have to be built for you, not generally available
- Scarce and valuable
- Building competitive advantage
- Increasing investment and development

**Examples**: Specialized software platforms, unique customer experiences, proprietary processes and systems

**Strategic Focus**: Building capability and differentiation, creating competitive advantage, investing in scarce resources

#### 3. Product
"Stable, well-defined, widely available"

**Characteristics**:
- Stable and reliable
- Well-defined specifications
- Widely available from multiple providers
- Competitive market
- Standardized approaches

**Examples**: Standard software applications, established business processes, mature technologies and platforms, common industry practices

**Strategic Focus**: Optimization and efficiency, market positioning, cost management

#### 4. Commodity
"Ubiquitous, standardized, utility-like"

**Characteristics**:
- Ubiquitous availability
- Standardized specifications
- Utility-like reliability
- Low cost and high efficiency
- Minimal differentiation

**Examples**: Basic infrastructure (electricity, internet), standard services (hosting, storage), common business functions (payroll, accounting), commoditized technologies

**Strategic Focus**: Cost efficiency and scale, outsourcing and standardization, focus on higher-value activities

### How to Assess Evolution Stage

From Learn Wardley Mapping (https://learnwardleymapping.com/2021/05/13/evolution-one-bucket-or-another/):

**The Characteristics-Based Approach**:

> "To appreciate a Capability in terms of its Evolutionary Stage ('Data Center is stage 3') is to appreciate its qualities ('rapidly increasing ubiquity, rapid increase in use, failure not tolerated')."

**Key Assessment Dimensions** (from Simon Wardley's Evolution Characteristics Cheat Sheet):
- **Ubiquity**: How widespread is it?
- **Certainty**: How well understood is it?
- **Market**: What's the market maturity?
- **Failure tolerance**: How acceptable is failure?

**Practical Assessment Example** (from the article):

For a custom CRM capability:
- **Ubiquity** = Stage Two: "Slowly Increasing Consumption" - Used only by marketing and sales, not ubiquitous across company
- **Certainty** = Stage Three: "Rapid increases in use / fit for purpose" - Finding new integrations daily, departments aligning
- **Failure** = Stage Two: "Moderate / unsurprising but disappointed" - Fails more often than it should, affecting adoption

**When Components Are Hard to Place**:

> "If you are having a hard time placing it on the evolutionary axis, that's a tell that there are multiple concepts being represented by that one word. So you need to disambiguate, which requires careful thought."

**Two Strategies When Stuck**:

1. **Map First**: "If you're early in the process... just keep moving. Pick something roughly in the middle and move on. (You can make it more 'accurate' later.) Don't get stuck."

2. **Break the Component Down**: "Examine the thing closely. Make notes, sketch it out, or phone a thoughtful friend. Once you've unbundled the component into its constituent parts, you can loop back to the first step."

### Strategic Decision Framework

From Wardley Maps Official (https://www.wardleymaps.com/glossary/evolution-stages):

**Where Should We Invest?**
"Focus on components in Genesis and Custom Built stages, where you can create competitive advantage through innovation and differentiation."

**What Should We Outsource?**
"Consider components in the Product and Commodity stages, where standardized solutions are available and cost-effective."

**How Do We Compete?**
"Differentiate on evolving components (Genesis, Custom Built), optimize on stable ones (Product, Commodity)."

**What's Changing?**
"Monitor components moving between stages to anticipate opportunities and threats."

### Understanding Inertia

From Wardley Maps Official (https://www.wardleymaps.com/glossary/inertia):

**Definition**: "Inertia is the resistance to change that builds up in organizations."

> "Think of it like Newton's first law - things at rest stay at rest. Organizations keep doing what they've always done unless something forces them to change. This becomes dangerous when the world shifts around you but you're still stuck in the old ways."

**The Paradox of Success**:

> "The problem is past success creates the strongest inertia. When something works well, we want to keep it exactly as it is. But in a changing world, what worked yesterday might kill you tomorrow."

**Why Inertia Persists**:

> "Here's the thing - people love learning new skills when they choose to (because they see the upside). But they hate being forced to learn because their old knowledge became worthless. It's like your car - you know when it's old and worth less. But when your knowledge gets old? You rarely notice. You still think it's valuable."

**Power Dynamics**: "And there's another layer - some people will lose power when things change. They'll fight tooth and nail to keep the status quo because change threatens their position."

#### Types of Inertia

**Customer Inertia**:
- Customers have invested in learning your solution
- Changes render existing knowledge useless
- Requires additional investment to adapt
- Creates resistance to innovation

**The Good News**: "Customer inertia goes away when a contract (API) is put in place. You can do whatever you want as long as you don't invalidate customer knowledge!"

**Vendor Inertia**:
- **Asset-heavy operations**: "Being asset-heavy makes it challenging to change almost by definition because you have a lot of things to sell"
- **Employee investment**: "Your employees invest in particular skills and build their position based on them; they may ignore the fact that reality has changed"
- **Reinforced behaviors**: "All your incentives may reinforce existing behaviors"
- **Uncertainty**: "The fear of the unknown makes people prefer what they have over what they could have"

#### Inertia and Evolution Stages

From Wardley Maps Official (https://www.wardleymaps.com/glossary/inertia):

> "Inertia is particularly problematic during evolution stage transitions:"

- **Custom-Built to Product**: "Organizations resist standardization - custom-built solutions usually come with big margins."
- **Product to Commodity**: "Organizations resist industrialization and utility-like operations - adoption, sales incentives and practices are not ready for volume sales"

**Competitive Advantage**: "Organizations that can overcome inertia faster than competitors gain significant competitive advantage. The ability to adapt quickly becomes a core competency."

### Context Sensitivity in Evolution

From Learn Wardley Mapping (https://learnwardleymapping.com/2021/05/13/evolution-one-bucket-or-another/):

**Context Matters**:

The article emphasizes that evolution is context-dependent. The same component can be at different stages for different organizations based on their market, capabilities, and understanding.

**Ubiquity is to the applicable market** - not universal ubiquity. What's commodity to one organization might be genesis to another.

**Certainty is a measure** of how well understood, defined, and stable something is within your context.

## Strategic Analysis: Climate, Doctrine, and Gameplay

### Climate Patterns: External Forces

From Learn Wardley Mapping (https://learnwardleymapping.com/climate/):

**Definition**: "Climate — the external forces acting upon it. These are the broader rules of the game, the patterns of the seasons, and competitor actions."

**Core Climate Patterns**:

#### Pattern 1: Everything Evolves Through Supply and Demand Competition

> "If the conditions exist that a person or groups of people will strive to gain some form of advantage or control over others due to a constraint (i.e. a limitation of a resource or time or money or people) then we have competition."

> "If competition exists then the components effected will evolve until they become industrialised. This impacts everything from activities (what we do), practices (how we do something), data (how we measure something) to knowledge (how we understand something)."

#### Pattern 2: Characteristics Change as Capabilities Evolve

> "The characteristics of a component in the uncharted space are not the same as the characteristics of the same component when it becomes industrialised."

**Key Insight**: "A company has to manage both the extremes along with the evolution between them. It's really important to remember that there is a transition from uncharted to industrialised. Don't organise by the extremes alone."

**Climate Pattern Categories** (from Learn Wardley Mapping):
- **Competition**: How market forces drive evolution
- **Components (Capabilities)**: How components change over time
- **Finances**: Economic patterns and effects
- **Inertia**: Resistance to change patterns
- **Prediction**: Anticipatable patterns
- **Speed**: Pace of evolution patterns

### Doctrine: Universal Principles

From Wardley Maps Official (https://www.wardleymaps.com/doctrine):

**Definition**: "A set of 40 universal principles for strategic success, focusing on situational awareness, user needs, and adaptability in dynamic environments."

**Why "Doctrine"?**: These are principles that apply universally, regardless of context. They represent best practices that organizations should almost always apply.

#### The Four Phases of Doctrine

**Phase I: Foundation Principles**
Focus: Communication, Development, Operation, Learning

Key Principles:
- **Common Language**: Effective collaboration requires a shared language
- **Challenge Assumptions**: Allow people to ask questions and challenge assumptions

### Gameplay: Context-Dependent Strategic Moves

From Wardley Maps Official (https://www.wardleymaps.com/glossary/gameplay):

**Definition**: "Wardley Mapping gameplays are concrete, repeatable strategic actions you can deploy to influence your competitive environment. Unlike universal principles (doctrine), gameplays are context-dependent—specific to your users, landscape, climate, and organizational purpose."

**How to Use Gameplays**:
1. Map the situation (users, needs, components, dependencies)
2. Analyze the landscape to identify constraints, inertia, duplication, and mismatches
3. Select gameplays that match your specific context (often combining multiple plays)
4. Execute iteratively; measure outcomes; adapt based on results

## Key Takeaways for Facilitators

1. **Embrace Messiness**: Perfect maps don't exist. "An incorrect model that is also useful is the definition of success."

2. **Choose Your Approach**: Match facilitation style to group size and context—wing it for small groups, cross-pollinate for larger ones.

3. **Surface Assumptions**: The value is in making implicit assumptions explicit, not necessarily achieving complete agreement.

4. **Start Simple**: One user, one need, build from there. Don't speculate or start too broad.

5. **Focus on Story**: If the map tells a clear story, it's working. Test this with people who weren't in the creation session.

6. **Build Shared Language**: The process of mapping together creates vocabulary for nuanced strategic conversations.

7. **Iterate and Experiment**: "Try each of these out, mix and match, and invent your own!" (Learn Wardley Mapping)

## Notes for AI Agent Context

This research note compiles facilitation approaches for Wardley Mapping from authoritative sources. When developing prompts or workflows:

- **For conversational/guided creation**: Consider the "Wing It" or "Get Strict" approaches, adapted for one-on-one interaction
- **For transcript analysis**: Focus on extracting users, needs, capabilities, and evolution stages from discussion content
- **Key facilitation principles**: Ask clarifying questions, surface assumptions, embrace uncertainty, build incrementally
- **Quality checks**: Can the map tell a story? Does it capture the value chain from user perspective?
- **Evolution placement**: When uncertain, use comparative positioning (least common left, most common right) rather than absolute precision

The sources emphasize that Wardley Mapping is learned by doing, not by achieving perfection. Facilitators should encourage experimentation and iteration over correctness.
