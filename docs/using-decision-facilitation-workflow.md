# Using the Decision Facilitation Workflow

## What is Drucker's Decision-Making Framework?

Peter Drucker's Elements of Decision Making is a systematic approach to making effective decisions that actually get implemented. The framework emphasizes:

- **Understanding the problem** - Is this generic (requiring a rule) or exceptional (one-off)?
- **Defining boundary conditions** - What must the solution satisfy?
- **Thinking "right" before "feasible"** - Identify the ideal solution before compromising
- **Building in action** - Who needs to know, what must be done, can they actually do it?
- **Creating feedback loops** - How will you know if this works?

The framework recognizes that **the hardest part of decision-making isn't choosing** - it's translating that choice into organizational reality.

## The Challenge: Discipline is Hard Without Structure

Good decision-making techniques are well-known but difficult to apply consistently:

**The problem**: When facing a decision, most people:
- Jump to solutions without understanding the problem
- Accept the first option that seems workable ("whether or not" thinking)
- Define "right" with compromises already baked in
- Plan actions without checking if people can actually execute them
- Forget to build in feedback mechanisms

**Why this happens**:
- Decision fatigue makes shortcuts tempting
- Political pressures encourage premature compromise
- Documentation feels like extra work
- No structure to guide systematic thinking

This creates a pattern: decisions get made on paper but fail in practice because the organizational implementation was never properly addressed.

## The Solution: AI-Facilitated Decision Process

The decision facilitation workflow provides structure and discipline for applying Drucker's framework. Instead of trying to remember all the steps yourself, you:

1. Invoke the workflow with your decision topic
2. The AI guides you through 7 phases with explicit questions
3. You provide insights and context at each step
4. The AI captures your responses in two documents as you go
5. You end with both a formal Decision Record and a Discussion Log

The AI's job is to:
- **Ask the right questions at the right time** (not provide answers)
- **Capture your thinking** as you work through the decision
- **Guide you through the process** systematically
- **Document as you go** so you don't face a blank page at the end

## Understanding the Workflow's Role

This workflow is fundamentally different from asking AI for decision advice:

### What the AI Does NOT Do
- Make the decision for you
- Provide expert domain knowledge
- Know your organizational context
- Understand your political realities

### What the AI DOES Do
- **Facilitate your thinking** through structured questions
- **Prevent common mistakes** (jumping to solutions, single-option thinking)
- **Ensure completeness** (all phases covered before moving forward)
- **Reduce documentation burden** (captures as you go)
- **Manage decision fatigue** (checkpoints to pause/resume)

Think of it as having a disciplined facilitator who keeps you on track, asks probing questions, and takes notes - but the insights and decisions are entirely yours.

## Real-World Application

### When to Use This Workflow

**Good fits:**
- Strategic decisions (organizational direction, major initiatives)
- Operational decisions (process changes, resource allocation)
- Tactical decisions (implementation approaches, timeline trade-offs)
- Decisions requiring organizational buy-in and execution

**Not suitable for:**
- Trivial decisions (overkill for low-impact choices)
- Decisions that should be delegated
- Decisions that don't need to be made yet

### Example Scenario

**Situation**: You manage an internal learning initiative designed to teach 3,000 employees a critical skill. Six months in, you realize the program isn't accomplishing its main goal - people are completing the training but not applying the learning. Now there's a time crunch: leadership wants to see measurable skill application within the next quarter.

**Without the workflow**:
- Rush to "fix" the program with surface changes
- Debate whether to scrap it or double down
- Make changes without understanding root cause
- Implement without checking if trainers can execute
- No clear success metrics

**With the workflow**:

**Phase 0-1: Problem Classification**
- Recognize this is a **generic problem** (training transfer failure is common)
- Identify as **complex domain** (requires experimentation, not best practices)
- Assess as **two-way door** (program changes can be tested and adjusted)
- Timeline: Need measurable impact in one quarter

**Phase 2: Boundary Conditions**
- Must have: Measurable skill application, works within existing resources, completed in 3 months
- Nice to have: Minimal disruption to current participants, reusable for future cohorts
- Constraints: Can't hire external trainers, must use existing learning platform

**Phase 3: Trade-off Evaluation**
- **Option 1**: Add post-training coaching (high impact, requires trainer time)
- **Option 2**: Redesign for practice-based learning (medium impact, requires content rework)
- **Option 3**: Create peer accountability groups (low resource, uncertain impact)

Evaluate positives, negatives, and feasibility of each.

**Phase 4: Feasible Solution**
- Select Option 1 with elements of Option 3
- Compromise: Use existing managers as coaches (not ideal but feasible)
- Political reality: Need to show quick wins to maintain leadership support

**Phase 5: Implementation Planning** (CRITICAL)
- **Who needs to know**: Managers (coaching role), participants (new expectations), leadership (timeline)
- **Actions required**: Train managers on coaching, update program materials, create accountability structure
- **Can they do it?**: 
  - Managers: Need 2-hour coaching training (can do)
  - Participants: Need clear expectations (can do)
  - Platform team: Need to add tracking (need 2 weeks, have capacity)
- **Communication plan**: Manager briefing next week, participant email, leadership update in 2 weeks

**Phase 6: Feedback Design**
- **Success criteria**: 60% of participants apply skill in real work within 6 weeks
- **Metrics**: Skill application tracking, manager observations, participant self-reports
- **Review schedule**: Weekly for first month, then bi-weekly
- **Failure condition**: If <30% application after 4 weeks, revisit approach

The workflow guided you to:
- Understand this as a generic problem (training transfer) requiring a systematic solution
- Generate and evaluate multiple options instead of accepting the first idea
- Identify the "right" solution (intensive coaching) then adapt to feasibility (manager-led)
- Critically assess whether managers can actually coach (and provide training)
- Build in clear metrics and failure conditions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Clear decision topic** - Come with a specific decision to make
2. **Time commitment** - Plan for 1-2 hours for a complete session (can pause/resume)
3. **Organizational context** - Be ready to share political realities and constraints

### Invocation Format

```
I need to make a decision about [TOPIC/SITUATION].

[Optional: Initial context about the situation, constraints, or urgency]
```

**Example invocations**:
- "I need to make a decision about restructuring our customer support team to handle 40% more volume."
- "I need to make a decision about whether to continue our quarterly planning process or switch to continuous planning."
- "I need to make a decision about how to handle a major client asking for custom features that don't align with our product strategy."

### What to Expect

The workflow will:

1. **Check if this is the right workflow** (redirect technical decisions to Design Buddy)
2. **Create two documents**:
   - Discussion Log (your exploration and thinking)
   - Decision Record (formal artifact)
3. **Guide through 7 phases** with explicit wait points:
   - Phase 0: Initialize & Early Filters
   - Phase 1: Problem Classification
   - Phase 2: Boundary Conditions & "Right" Solution
   - Phase 3: Trade-off Evaluation
   - Phase 4: Feasible Solution
   - Phase 5: Implementation Planning
   - Phase 6: Feedback Design
4. **Offer pause points** after Phases 2, 3, and 5 to manage decision fatigue
5. **Build documents progressively** so you see progress throughout

### Tips for Success
**Generate real alternatives**: Don't just evaluate one option. The research shows single-option decisions fail over 50% of the time.

**Focus on capability**: When planning implementation, really ask "Can they do it?" Don't assume people have the skills, permissions, or resources.

**Use the parking lot**: When you identify sub-decisions or follow-up work, note them in the parking lot rather than derailing the current decision.

**Take breaks is ok!**: Decision fatigue is real. The workflow offers three pause points - use them if you're feeling overwhelmed.

## The Two Documents Created

### Discussion Log
**Purpose**: Capture the exploration and thinking process

**Contains**:
- Your initial request and context
- Questions asked and answers provided
- Insights that emerged during facilitation
- Parking lot items for follow-up
- The "why behind the why"

**Location**: `Capture/YYYYMMDDHHNN - Decision Discussion - [Topic].md`

**Use it for**: Understanding how you arrived at the decision, reviewing your thinking, identifying patterns in your decision-making

### Decision Record
**Purpose**: Formal artifact documenting the decision

**Contains**:
- Problem classification (Cynefin domain, generic/exceptional, reversibility)
- Boundary conditions (must-haves, nice-to-haves, constraints)
- Trade-off analysis (options evaluated)
- Chosen approach and rationale
- Implementation plan (who, what, capability assessment)
- Feedback mechanisms (success criteria, metrics, failure conditions)
- Consequences (what gets easier/harder, risks)

**Location**: User-specified (often project ADR folder or `Capture/`)

**Use it for**: Communicating the decision, onboarding new team members, reviewing decisions later, establishing principles for future decisions
